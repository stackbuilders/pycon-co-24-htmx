# PyCon Colombia 2024 - Less JavaScript and more Python with HTMX

This repository contains the example shown in the presentation
"Less JavaScript and more Python with HTMX" at the PyCon Colombia 2024.

## Motivation

Promote the HTMX library and explaining how it works in a simple Web Application.

## Install

Install [devenv](https://devenv.sh/)

## Usage

Spawn a [nix-shell]:

```
devenv shell
```

*Note:* This step may take a while the first time the command is executed
because it installs all the project requirements.

Start the Flask server:

```
devenv up
```

This will run the Flask server and you would be able to see the application in
http://localhost:5000

## License

MIT.

## Contributing

Feel free to use this repository for testing the HTMX library. If you find
something that could be improved for other learners do not hesitate to sumbit
a pull request for changes.
